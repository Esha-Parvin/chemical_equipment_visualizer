# Chemical Equipment Visualizer - Frontend

This is the React frontend for the Chemical Equipment Visualizer application.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory with:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

For production, set the `REACT_APP_API_URL` to your deployed backend API URL.

## Deploying to Vercel

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run `vercel` in the frontend directory
3. Follow the prompts to link your project
4. Set the environment variable in Vercel:
   ```
   vercel env add REACT_APP_API_URL
   ```
5. Deploy to production: `vercel --prod`

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import your repository
3. Set the **Root Directory** to `frontend`
4. Add the environment variable:
   - Name: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - Value: Your backend API URL (e.g., `https://your-api.example.com`)
5. Deploy!

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `REACT_APP_API_URL` | The URL of your backend API server |

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
